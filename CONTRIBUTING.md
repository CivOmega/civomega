# Contributing to CivOmega

Sort of doing a cheap [GitHub Flow](http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html),
where we'll have a `develop` branch and a `master` branch that will ALWAYS be
in "good to deploy" condition.

In-progress goes in `develop`.

Due to small team size and all that, core developers will just work directly
on CivOmega/civomega and use feature branches for big stuff. You can still
send pull-requests against branches, by doing going to a URL like:

```https://github.com/CivOmega/civomega/compare/foo...develop```

where `foo` is the name of the feature branch you're thinking of merging into
`develop` but want a second opinion on.
